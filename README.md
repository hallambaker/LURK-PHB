# LURK-PHB
Implementation of protocol meeting proposed requirements for possible IETF LURK working group.

# Project Dependencies

This project makes use of the libraries supplied in the Mathematical Mesh. This is also available
as a SourceForce and GitHub repository.

Right now the libraries are not properly packaged up as nuget packages. So the way to buld the
project is to layer the source code trees so that Visual Studio can find the bits it needs.

My source code tree is 

...\Work\mmm\       <Mathematical Mesh code here>
        \LURK-PHB\  <Lurk Code here>

Hoping to get this fixed soon.
